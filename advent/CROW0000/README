This is an "original" (pre-Don-Woods) version of Colossal Cave Adventure,
written by Will Crowther. Long believed lost, this was found from a backup
of Don Wood's student account thanks to the efforts of Dennis Jerz. Included
are three versions of the Fortran-IV source code, along with two versions of
the data file. The f77/ subdirectory contains the same code ported to
Fortran 77 by Matthew Russotto in 2007.
