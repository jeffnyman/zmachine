# The MDL Programming Language

S. W. Galley and Greg Pfister

This repository contains a Markdown representation of *The MDL Programming Language* by S. W. Galley and Greg Pfister, originally written with support from the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense (DARPA).

Here I'll cover some of the sources, credits and legalities should any of those interest you.

## Transcription and Sources

This document has been transcribed by [Mark Trapp](https://marktrapp.com) and [Jesse McGrew](https://bitbucket.org/jmcgrew) from a [PDF maintained by the Defense Technical Information Center](http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA070930). This transcription attempts to be as faithful to the original as possible deviating only to adopt modern formatting techniques, account for limitations of the Markdown format in particular and the web in general, and adding links where appropriate.

To this end, the original language has been maintained as much as humanly possible. According to the transcribers, when an apparent error in the original text was noticed, they've indicated that error with a *[sic]* annotation. When the transcribers felt that the text required clarification, they entered "transcriber's notes."

If you happen to be reading this documents and you do happen to notice an actual error or an area requiring clarification, the transcribers ask that you [create an issue](https://github.com/taradinoc/mdl-docs/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/taradinoc/mdl-docs/pulls).

## Copyright (Such As It Is)

Various factors need to be considered and determining the copyright status of a work can be involved. For example, you have to ask:

* What country or countries was the workpublished in?
* When was it published?
* Was an appropriate copyright noticed included?

There was a time when copyright wasn't automatic as it is now. What that means is proper copyright notices used to be required and if they were either missing or inadequate in some way, it could result in loss of copyright on the work involved. (Ask the folks who made *Night of the Living Dead* about that. Short story is that forgetting a copyright meant that the film entred the public domain.)

Another factor to consider is if any required filings were made with the U.S. Copyright Office at the time.

Due to these various factors, which have changed over time, [Cornell's Copyright Information Center](http://copyright.cornell.edu/) publishes a guide that can be useful in helping to determine the copyright status of a work: [http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm).

Here's some background of the MDL Programming Language document.

Various versions of it were published from 1972 to at least 1979. Some had a copyright notice and some didn't. Greg Pfister, the original author of the document, has (according to the transcribers) said that the 1972 version does not have such a notice. I have no independent confirmation of that.

What's more certain is that the 1979 version that was submitted to the U.S. Government and that is on file with the Defense Technical Information Center, and linked to above, does not any such notice. In addition, this document was not registered with the U.S. Copyright Office at any point, which can be confirmed with a search. However, just to keep the story interesting, a copy of the 1979 version from the MIT Library *does* contain a copyright notice.

What all of this shows is this document was originally published without a copyright notice and that such a notice was added by MIT to other copies later on. It seems that at least seven years had gone by (and possibly longer since it is not known when MIT actually stamped their copy with a notice about 1979) since the earlier versions do not have this.

The chart provided by Cornell's Copyright Information Center indicates a few things:
 
* Publishing with a copyright notice *was* required for the 1972 version.
* Also required was either a notice or subsequent registration with the U.S. Copyright Office *within five years* (for the later versions).
* Loss of copyright would result if the previous step was not taken.

In addition, and adding to the lack of a straight answer, this document is the result of work first produced in the performance of a contract to the U.S. Government. While a work prepared by an officer or employee of the federal government as part of that person's official duties is free of copyright this does not necessarily extend to contractors.

Indeed, if you really want to dig in, FAR 52.227-14(c)(1)(ii) lets contractors assert copyright when it says that:

> "when authorized to assert copyright to the data, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notices of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402, and an acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number)."

Riveting, yes?

Okay, so, while the MDL Programming Language document submitted to the U.S.  Government *does* include an acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including a contract number) it *does not* contain the required copyight notice. This is assuming that MIT was authorized to assert copyright on the data submitted to the government in the first place because FAR does say "when authorized to assert copyright."

What all of this is showing us is that that, if MIT *wanted* to claim a copyright on what they sent to the U.S. Government, and assuming that their contract actually permitted them to, they really needed to include a copyright notice. This backs up the information provided by Cornell's Copyright Information Center that a copyright notice was required. Again with the caveat that they were authorized to assert copyright in the first place.

At the very least this means we can say that the MDL Programming Language as submitted to the U.S. Government (and very probably all of the other versions that did not contain copyright notices) are therefore in the public domain in the United States for failure to comply with the required formalities. This means you're free to download, modify and redistribute this document. In fact, that's exactly what I've done as have the transcribers mentioned earlier.

People outside of the United States _should_ probably check the copyright laws of their country before downloading or redistributing.

Now let's say the worst happens. Even if it should be found that this document is somehow under copyrigh and someone actually cared enough to raise a stink about it. The U.S. Government's copy has the [distribution statement "A"](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/submit/distribution_limitations_and_statements.html) attached to it, meaning that it is approved for public release and that distribution is unlimited. This classification, along with the exhaustive (and perhaps exhausting) information above, is the basis under which a good-faith effort to preserve an otherwise-public document has been made.
