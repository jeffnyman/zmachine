The Apple II ZIP was written by Bruce Daniels, who was working at Apple Computer at the time. Bruce was one of the key players in the development of the Apple Lisa computer; he was responsible for the system software.

Infocom games are written in ZIL and compiled to z-code. That z-code was interpreted on a ZIP interpreter. ZIP interpreters were written for many computer architectures. This includes the Apple II and that's relevant becasue the zip.asm file contains a large portion of the reverse-engineered Apple II ZIP interpreter. Specifically, it contains an interpreter for versions 1 through 3. This was work done by Eric Smith back in 1984.

ZIP version 1 is only known to have been used for Zork I release 2 -- which might not even have been released for the Apple II -- as well as Zork I release 5. ZIP version 2 is only known to have been used for Zork I release 15 and Zork II release 7. Later releases of the Zork games, as well as many other Infocom games, use ZIP version 3. Eventually game images exceeded the 128 kilobyte limit of ZIP version 3. This eventually led to new ZIP versions 4, 5, and 6, also known as EZIP, XZIP, and YZIP, respectively.

The PDF in this directory has the following context:

The code was assembled using a special version of the Microsoft Macro-80 assembler that was part of the A.L.D.S. package for the Apple II. Macro-80 ran under CP/M, and the normal versions only supported 8080 and Z-80 assembly. But the A.L.D.S. version added support for the 6502, and ran under CP/M on an Apple II equipped with a Microsoft Softcard.

In 1984, the listing file was uploaded to a DECSYSTEM-20 and printed on a DEC LN01 laser printer (DEC's version of the Xerox 2700).

The PDF is scanned from a printed listing.
